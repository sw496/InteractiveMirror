Making a Mirror
====

[Video walk-through on adafruit (Thank you Becky!)](https://learn.adafruit.com/android-smart-home-mirror)

1. Obtain Android device
----
We had too many. Sad old devices are ideal.


2. Obtain two-way mirror
---
We did this the old-fashioned way, and quested to [Canal Plastic Center](http://canalplastic.com/). A beautiful and highly recommended establishment. 


Get a mirror at least as large as your Android device. My mirror is 6"x12" with 1/8 thickness. 

3. Sticky stuff for mounting
---
Our trickiest problem was figuring out how to mount everything with minimal damage and error.
We eventually discovered [reusable double-sided adhesive](http://www.amazon.com/Command-Assorted-8-Small-4-Medium-4-Large/dp/B0084M68IO/ref=pd_sim_sbs_229_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=1TX12CR5RF0RTP6CKJR7&dpSrc=sims&dpST=_AC_UL320_SR202%2C320_), which is amazing. 

We're using it both to mount the mirror to the device, and the device to the wall.

4. Attach black backing
---
We used black construction paper. If your device and mirror are awesomely identical in size, you can skip this.

Note: You want to glue it well, so the backing doesn't tear when the adhesive is holding it.

* Cut a piece of black backing the same size as your mirror
* Decide where you want your device to show through. We did upper right. Leave a border all the way around for adhesive.
* At that location, carefully cut a hole in the backing the same size as your device
* CAREFULLY glue the backing to the mirror. We used spray adhesive, and practiced how we would pick it up and lay it on the mirror a couple times before going for it. We also wore black surgical gloves.

5. Adhesion
---
Fire up the app on the device.

Put the adhesive along the bezel or edges of the device. Line up the mirror and stick it on there.

6. Wall spot
---
You probably want a long usb cable. Find a wall spot where you can keep the device plugged in.

Put a bunch of adhesive on the back of the device, and stick it on there.

At the heart of this project, is 'put a mirror on it'. [Check out alternative mirror projects and feel free to add your own reflections](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror/wiki/Other-mirror-projects-with-alternate-technologies)
